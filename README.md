## Hello!

### My name is Ben   
![This is me](/images/Ben_pic.JPG | width=100)
This is my cover letter for Patreon, a company that I would absolutlely LOVE to work at!    
Your mission of supporting creators is one that really resonates with me.    
I have creator friends who I try to support as well:

I want to help them and other creators around the world, Patreon is the place to do that.  

## How can I help Patreon help it's creators? with DATA   
I've been using data to answer questions and solve problems for a long time now  

- What's the best coffeeshop in Austin? [There's a spreadsheet for that](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ej90jWdd38xZb2M440tFu2RBhw0qJF92Jl6uLJeZU5A/edit?usp=sharing)
- Can you really taste the difference between red velvet and chocolate cake? [There's a spreadsheet for that](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-mqfiPSJpwAZFdIneJR1HSIZY6rC7ZfcZa_cJdHnmg0/edit?usp=sharing)

Here's a more useful one:  
- When should all the interns who have different schedules and are located in different parts of the country meet up? [There's a spreadsheet for that](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cYUTfm4D-B3j6mDdcGZA84LX3IJzBRVbM7zbRk5V8Xo/edit?usp=sharing)

### I also have been learning Python over the past few years and recently got accepted into a Data Science bootcamp! 
My resume can tell you more about this or you can also check out my [Github](https://github.com/Bench-amblee?tab=repositories) to see what I've been working on.  
I can confidently work on any project that involves
- Python, including libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, streamlit, and seaborn
- HTML/CSS (and markdown files to like the one you're reading now)
- Excel
- SQL
- Tableau
- Git  
And I can pick up skills that I'm not familiar with like RedShift, R, and Amplitude. I'm learning more about Data Science every day and would love to add these programs to my repetoire.

## I have plenty of experience working with marketing analytics and using data to make decisions
I worked at a digital marketing company in Austin where we supported a lot of independent business using analytics.
Whether it was to engage with their clients more on social media or to post more frequently, the rest of the team and I helped a lot of businesses succeed just by interpreting data, answering questions, and solving problems. 
### I'd love to do the same at Patreon
If you've gotten this far, thank you so much for reading through this whole letter!  
I'd love to talk more about Patreon's goals for this position and how I can help achieve them.   
Thanks again, I hope to hear from you soon!
