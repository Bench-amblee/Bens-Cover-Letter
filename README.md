## Hello!

### My name is Ben    
This is my cover letter for Hungryroot, a company that I would absolutely love to work with! Your mission for making healthy eating accesible and sustainable is one that really resonates with me. 

I'm also very passionate about food: 

- Here's a spreadsheet I made to keep track of my favorite coffeeshops in Austin: [Click me!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ej90jWdd38xZb2M440tFu2RBhw0qJF92Jl6uLJeZU5A/edit#gid=0)

- I also did a report for the pizza place I used to work at to determine which food item was the best (in terms of calories per $), this also includes a "app" where you can build your own 3 topping pizza and it will give you a rank based on the total amount of calories: [Click me!](https://benchamblee.blog/2020/03/25/239/) 
       
I want to continue to use data and my passion for food to work on awesome projects like these - and Hungryroot looks like an amazing place to do that

### What would make me a good data scientist? 
Good question! I started learning python a little over two years ago, but I really got into it after quarantine started. I used those skills to get accepted into an online data science bootcamp which I'm finishing up now!

My resume can tell you more about this or you can also check out my [Github](https://github.com/Bench-amblee?tab=repositories) to see what I've been working on. 

I can confidently work on any project that involves
- Python, including libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, streamlit, and seaborn
- Machine Learning models with scikit-learn including regression, correlation, random forest, gradient boosting, etc.
- HTML/CSS (and markdown files to like the one you're reading now)
- SQL, MySQL Server, SQLite
- Excel and Google Sheets
- Tableau
- Git/Github  
And I can pick up skills that I'm not familiar with like R and the best practices for a D2C business. I'm learning more about Data Science every day and would love to take on new challenges.

### I have plenty of experience working with marketing analytics and using data to make decisions
I worked at a digital marketing startup in Austin where we supported a lot of independent businesses using analytics.
Whether it was to engage with their clients more on social media or to post more frequently, the rest of the team and I helped a lot of businesses succeed just by interpreting data, answering questions, and solving problems. 
## I'd love to do the same at Hungryroot
If you've gotten this far, thank you so much for reading through this whole letter! I'd love to talk more about Hungryroots's goals for this position and how I can help achieve them.      
Thank you again, I hope to hear from you soon!
